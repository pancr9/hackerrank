### Program to Find the Maximum Depth or Height of a Tree

The height of a binary tree is the number of edges between the tree's root and its furthest leaf. 

This means that a tree containing a single node has a height of 0.

Complete the getHeight function provided in your editor so that it returns the height of a binary tree.

This function has a parameter, 'root', which is a pointer to the root node of a binary tree. 

Note -The Height of binary tree with single node is taken as zero.

### Input Format

You do not need to read any input from stdin. Our grader will pass the root node of a binary tree to your getHeight function.

### Output Format

Your function should return a single integer denoting the height of the binary tree.
